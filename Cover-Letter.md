Subject: Application for Senior Software Developer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Software Developer position at Hexagon, as recently advertised. My name is Josmi Jose, and I am currently in the final semester of my two-year postgraduate diploma in Digital Design and Development at North Island College.

My academic journey has been an immersive experience, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of various educational systems and significantly contributing to my personal and professional development. The program's diverse curriculum has enhanced my design talents, covering UI/UX fundamentals, digital graphics, and culminating in a full Capstone project. This project, which involved the creation of a design system and a responsive website for a hair salon using React.js, underscored my ability to transform design concepts into a functional and visually appealing web presence.

Over the course of two years, I have actively improved my web development skills, including expertise in CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and WordPress. I successfully completed a front-end capstone project utilizing React.js, showcasing my adaptability and commitment to staying current with emerging technologies.

I bring over five years of professional software development experience to the table. My experience includes a range of projects, such as developing a full food recipe application with both front-end and back-end functionality using PHP and MySQL. I have also served in roles such as Technical Lead at Infosys and Software Engineer at Cognizant, where I applied my web development skills to projects involving vessel contract operations, water supply, and recycling services for millions of customers.

My internship at Sprint Technologies Pvt. Ltd focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, C#, MVC, and included the successful completion of a mini-project. These experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded skill set and a practical understanding of real-world software development scenarios.

My long-term professional goal is to become a full-stack engineer specializing in design and development with a focus on database management. Starting as a .NET developer, I am committed to continuous learning and staying abreast of evolving technologies. Notably, I self-taught React.js for my capstone project, demonstrating my adaptability and drive to keep current on developing technologies.

For my upcoming capstone project, I plan to create a Stock Record Application using React.js and database development. This project is designed to meet the unique inventory management needs of organizations, particularly in the healthcare sector. It aligns seamlessly with my career goals, offering a practical opportunity to demonstrate my full-stack development skills while addressing a tangible organizational requirement.

I am excited about the prospect of contributing to Hexagon's Mining division and leveraging my expertise in C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Redux. My commitment to maintaining high-quality code, combined with my strong understanding of design patterns, makes me confident in my ability to excel in this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of Hexagon.

Sincerely,

Josmi Jose
