## Biography

As a back-end developer,specialized in creating and implementing projects that enable effective item organization within organizational contexts. My knowledge will extend across the entire development lifecycle, from design and coding to unit testing and timely deployment.

As a team player, I will actively collaborate with my coworkers, providing meaningful feedback and promptly adopting suggestions within the constraints of stated schedules. 

While acknowledging that design may not be my primary talent, I will consistently strive to produce high-quality work.

As a programmer, I will remain committed to constantly learning and improving my programming skills. I will adapt to the specific requirements of the program, utilizing HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and DBMS as necessary for effective implementation. I learned .net technologies from the MNC companies like Cognizant and Infosys which I worked.

What will excites me is the output of each task by self study and overcoming the challenges faced in developing a feature.

## Critiques
### Brad
Clearly addresses each question.  First question is missing some context where skills were applied.  Second question response looks like it might have been generated by ChatGPT (recruiters will be suspicious).  It's a little vague about what exactly is exciting, since it focuses on process words (workflow, codebase, project launches).

### Priya

Just from the delivery of the content I felt you were a little not confident. Although you totally were.
